                    looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
                    amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                    found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                    weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                    completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working

                    "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
                    needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                    programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                    program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                    were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                    agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
                    learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                    have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
                    example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                    job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                    recommend!"
